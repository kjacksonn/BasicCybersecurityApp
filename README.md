## 🔍 How the Password Strength Checker Works (With Code Examples)

The Password Strength Checker looks at your password in simple steps.  
Each step adds or subtracts points to decide the final score (0–100).  
Here’s how it works, with real code examples from `PasswordStrength.kt`.

---

## 1️⃣ Step 1 — Check what the password contains

The app checks if the password uses:
- lowercase letters (a–z)
- uppercase letters (A–Z)
- numbers (0–9)
- symbols (! @ # ?)
- enough length

```kotlin
val length = pw.length
val hasLower = pw.any { it.isLowerCase() }
val hasUpper = pw.any { it.isUpperCase() }
val hasDigit = pw.any { it.isDigit() }
val hasSymbol = pw.any { !it.isLetterOrDigit() }
````

More variety = more points.

---

## 2️⃣ Step 2 — Give points for good habits

The app rewards stronger password choices:

```kotlin
var complexityBonus = 0.0

if (hasLower && hasUpper) complexityBonus += 5
if (hasDigit) complexityBonus += 5
if (hasSymbol) complexityBonus += 7
if (length >= 12) complexityBonus += 3
```

Longer, mixed-character passwords get higher scores.

---

## 3️⃣ Step 3 — Take away points for weak patterns

The app subtracts points for predictable or simple patterns:

```kotlin
if (hasLongRepeat(pw)) complexityBonus -= 8
if (hasSimpleSequence(pw)) complexityBonus -= 8
if (looksLikeDate(pw)) complexityBonus -= 5
```

This catches:

* repeated letters (aaa, 111)
* easy sequences (abc, 123)
* passwords that look like dates (12252000)

---

## 4️⃣ Step 4 — Detect super common passwords

The app checks if the password contains extremely common patterns:

```kotlin
val lowerPw = pw.lowercase()
val inCommonBase = commonBases.any { lowerPw.contains(it) }
val inKeyboardRun = keyboardRuns.any { lowerPw.contains(it) }

if (inCommonBase || inKeyboardRun) {
    score = minOf(score, 20)
}
```

Examples:

* “password”
* “qwerty”
* “abc123”

If it includes these, the score is capped low.

---

## 5️⃣ Step 5 — Create the final score and label

The final score is built from:

* good points
* minus bad points
* locked between 0 (weakest) and 100 (strongest)

```kotlin
var score = (randomnessPointsFromMath + complexityBonus)
    .toInt()
    .coerceIn(0, 100)
```

The score is then turned into a simple label:

```kotlin
val label = when (score) {
    in 0..19 -> "Very Weak"
    in 20..39 -> "Weak"
    in 40..59 -> "Fair"
    in 60..79 -> "Strong"
    else      -> "Excellent"
}
```

---

## 📝 Summary (Simple English)

* Good password habits **add** points
* Weak patterns **subtract** points
* Common passwords get forced to a low score
* The final score becomes a clear color bar and a label
* The checker gives tips on how to improve
* Everything runs **locally on the device** (nothing saved)
